# New York Data 
Data taken from Intellect in New York from a range of 580K onwards to 1,080,000 (500,000 rows) with revenue being under $1 million.<br>
For other parameters, I follow the instructions you gave me in the intern case study.

# Files in this repo
The "NY" folder contains the pre-cleaned 25 Excel files.<br>
The Python file is called mega_file_ny.ipynb <br>
This Python file also contains notes along the cleaning process for further clarification (the number of missing values and the number of rows we are left with).
